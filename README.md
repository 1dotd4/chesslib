# chesslib
A library for cryptographic attacks.

## Disclaimer
_Everything in this repo is currently unorganized and may hurt someone's feelings, please be aware this is still just a progressive dump._

## Usage
I'm currently trying to use cabal over stack for compatibility.

So for simple repl you can do the following:
```bash
cabal new-repl
```
For the setup you need a ghc compiler and cabal (or cabal-install) installed.

I'm looking for a good setup for IHaskell kernel in a comfy Jupyter notebooks so everyone can easly use it if needed.
